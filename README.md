# scsim2
Simulate single-cell RNA-SEQ data using the [Splatter statistical framework](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1305-0) but implemented in python with additional features. scsim2 is an extension of [scsim](https://github.com/dylkot/scsim) but now allowing an arbitrary number of activity programs to be simulated.
